## About Translations

Currently only English and Simplified Chinese are available. If you want to contribute your translation, here are the instructions:

1. [Fork this project](https://github.com/EverMCServer/vscode-BetonQuest/fork) and clone it down.

1. Search and install a [VSCode's Language Pack](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/locales) extension from the [marketplace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace) of which you want to translate. Then reload your VSCode.

1. There are only 3 files you need to change:

    - Copy `utils/src/i18n/data/en.json` to `utils/src/i18n/data/[locale_code].json` then translate it.

        The `[locale_code]` part is referer to the list [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/locales#_available-locales). If the locale contains a dash `-`, please convert it to an underscore `_`.

    - Copy `package.nls.json` to `package.nls.[locale-code].json` then translate it.

        This time you should not convert any dash to underscore.

    - Add new imports on `utils/src/i18n/i18n.ts`:

        ```typescript
        import en from './data/en.json';
        import zh_cn from './data/zh_cn.json';
        // ...
        import locale_code_with_underscore from './data/[locale_code_with_underscore].json'; // New

        // Translation table
        const translations: Map<string, TTranslation> = new Map([
            ["en", en as TTranslation],
            ["zh-cn", zh_cn as TTranslation],
            // ...
            ["[locale-code-with-dash]", locale_code_with_underscore as TTranslation], // New
        ]);

        // ...
        ```

1. If you want to test run the project. You need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) and do `npm install`. After that just reload your VSCode then hit `F5`.

1. Push your codes

1. Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/EverMCServer/vscode-BetonQuest/pulls) onto the `main` branch. Once everything checked your work will be merged.
